# Writing Style Guide

This repo contains writing skills and examples for content creation.

## Skill Hierarchy

1. **Root-level skills** (in this file and `/skills/`) apply to ALL content
2. **Folder-specific skills** (e.g., `/Newsletters/newsletter-writer-skill.md`) override root skills when there are conflicts

When writing content, always check for a skill file in the relevant folder first. If one exists, it takes priority over the general copywriting skill below.

## General Copywriting Skill

Use this as the foundation for all writing. Folder-specific skills override these guidelines when they conflict.

### Core Philosophy

- **Clarity over cleverness** — If you have to choose between clear and creative, choose clear
- **Benefits over features** — Focus on outcomes, not capabilities
- **Specificity over vagueness** — Concrete details beat abstract claims
- **Customer language over corporate jargon** — Write how people actually talk

### Before Writing, Gather Context

1. What is the purpose of this piece?
2. Who is the target audience?
3. What are their pain points?
4. What makes this different/valuable?
5. What action should they take?

### Writing Style Rules

**Vocabulary**
- Use simple words: "use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate", "start" not "commence"
- Avoid buzzwords: "streamline", "optimize", "leverage", "synergy", "revolutionize"
- Be specific: "saves 3 hours/week" beats "saves time"

**Voice & Tone**
- Active voice, not passive: "We built this" not "This was built"
- Confident without qualifiers: Cut "very", "really", "just", "actually"
- Conversational: Write like you talk
- Honest: Only claim what you can prove

**Structure**
- Lead with the most important information
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Use subheadings to break up long sections
- One idea per paragraph

### CTA Formula

**[Action Verb] + [What They Get] + [Qualifier]**

Good examples:
- "Start My Free Trial"
- "Get the Complete Checklist"
- "Join 10,000+ Subscribers"

Bad examples:
- "Submit"
- "Click Here"
- "Learn More"

### What to Avoid

- Corporate speak and jargon
- Passive voice
- Vague claims without proof
- Qualifiers that weaken statements
- Clever wordplay that sacrifices clarity
- Making promises you can't keep
