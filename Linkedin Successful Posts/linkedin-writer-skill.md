# LinkedIn Writer Skill

Use this skill when writing LinkedIn posts. This guide builds on the root copywriting skill and is optimized for B2B audiences and long-form professional content.

## LinkedIn vs Other Platforms

LinkedIn is different:
- **B2B focus** — Your readers are professionals, founders, operators, executives
- **Longer attention spans** — People scroll LinkedIn during work hours, expecting substantive content
- **Credibility matters** — Your title, company, and track record inform how posts land
- **Algorithm rewards engagement** — Comments > reactions > shares in terms of reach

## Post Types That Work

### 1. Thought Leadership / Opinion
Take a stance on something in your industry. Contrarian views perform well when backed by reasoning.

Example pattern:
> I think it's time to redefine what "success" means in SaaS.
> [Context on old way]
> that equation's collapsing. [Why]
> sam altman called it X. i disagree.
> i think we're entering the era of Y.
> [Memorable closing line]

### 2. Product Announcement
Lead with the outcome, not the feature list.

Example pattern:
> Introducing [thing] that is [specific metric] better at [outcome].
> [One-line summary of what changed]
> This is what's new:
> 1. [Feature]: [Benefit-first explanation]
> 2. [Feature]: [Benefit-first explanation]
> [Forward-looking statement + link]

### 3. Hiring / Team Growth
Make hiring posts feel like opportunities, not job descriptions.

Example pattern:
> I need to hire [big number] in [timeframe].
> [Company] is [exciting context].
> Our biggest bottleneck is [honest constraint].
> [Role 1]: [What they'll do + must-haves]
> [Role 2]: [Creative description + must-haves]
> Oh...one more thing...[surprising detail like comp]
> [Link]

### 4. Behind-the-Scenes / Show Your Work
Pull back the curtain on how you operate.

Example pattern:
> Our [team/process] is just me and [unexpected setup].
> I finally [action that reveals insight].
> Plus, [bonus insight from the process].
> [CTA if relevant]

### 5. Framework / How-To
Teach something actionable. Works especially well for operators sharing playbooks.

Example pattern:
> Here's how we [achieved outcome]:
> 1. [Step with context]
> 2. [Step with context]
> 3. [Step with context]
> [Results or what you learned]

## The Hook

LinkedIn shows ~150 characters before "...see more". That first line determines everything.

### Hook Patterns That Work

**Bold statement:**
> I need to hire 100 people in the next 12 months.

**Contrarian take:**
> I think it's time to redefine what "success" means in SaaS.

**Specific metric:**
> Introducing a smarter Lovable that is 71% better at solving complex tasks.

**Unexpected reveal:**
> Our marketing team is just me and ~40 AI agents.

**Problem statement:**
> that equation's collapsing.

### What Makes a Good Hook

- Specific > vague ("100 people" not "a lot of people")
- Surprising > expected (challenge assumptions)
- Personal > generic (your experience, your company)
- Complete thought > cliffhanger (LinkedIn isn't clickbait territory)

## Voice & Tone for LinkedIn

### Professional but Human
LinkedIn audiences expect substance, but not corporate speak. Write like a smart colleague, not a press release.

Good: "Our biggest bottleneck is keeping up hiring with the tidal wave of demand we're seeing."
Bad: "We are experiencing unprecedented growth and are actively seeking top talent."

### Lowercase is Acceptable
Notice successful posts often use lowercase for a conversational feel:
> for decades, it was measured by how big you could get
> that equation's collapsing
> i disagree

This works for thought leadership and opinion posts. Use proper capitalization for announcements and professional updates.

### Short Paragraphs
One idea per paragraph. LinkedIn's mobile experience rewards white space.

### Direct Address
Speak to specific roles when relevant:
> If a customer success savant & world-class PM had a baby, it'd look like our AI Strategist.

## Structure Best Practices

### For Short Posts (under 300 words)
```
[Hook - 1 strong line]
[Context - 2-3 sentences]
[Core insight or announcement]
[Memorable closing line]
[CTA if relevant]
```

### For Medium Posts (300-600 words)
```
[Hook]
[Context/Problem]
[Your take or solution]
[Supporting points - can be numbered]
[Implications or call to action]
[Link if relevant]
```

### For Long Posts (600+ words)
```
[Hook]
[Why this matters now]
[Section 1 with clear header or transition]
[Section 2]
[Section 3]
[What this means / where it's going]
[CTA]
```

### Formatting That Works

**Numbered lists** for features, steps, or multiple items:
> This is what's new:
> 1. Automated testing: Get higher quality builds...
> 2. More intelligent planning: Lovable maps out...

**Line breaks** for emphasis and readability

**Bold** for key phrases (use sparingly)

**Em dashes** for asides and emphasis

## CTAs That Work on LinkedIn

### Soft CTAs
> read more about today's update here: [link]
> Links to all jobs here: [link]

### Engagement CTAs
> Want to build your own team of AI agents? I'm teaching a class...

### No CTA
Sometimes the post stands alone. Not every post needs a link or ask.

## What to Avoid

From the root copywriting skill, plus LinkedIn-specific issues:

- **Corporate jargon** — "Excited to announce" "Thrilled to share" "Humbled to"
- **Hashtag spam** — 1-3 relevant hashtags max, at the end
- **Engagement bait** — "Agree?" "Thoughts?" without substance
- **Humble bragging** — Either share the win or don't
- **Wall of text** — Break up paragraphs, use white space
- **Vague hooks** — "Something interesting happened today..."
- **Over-explaining** — Trust your audience is smart
- **Repetitive parallel structure** — Avoid "No X. Just Y." patterns (feels AI-generated)
- **Generic takes** — "AI is changing everything" without specifics

## LinkedIn-Specific Considerations

### Timing
- Best engagement: Tuesday-Thursday, business hours
- Avoid: Weekends, late nights

### Media
- Native video and images get more reach than links
- Carousels (PDF uploads) perform well for frameworks
- Screenshots add credibility

### Comments
- Reply to comments quickly (first 1-2 hours matter most)
- Substantive replies boost the post
- Tag relevant people only if genuinely relevant

### Hashtags
- 1-3 max
- Place at the end
- Use established hashtags (#saas, #ai, #startup) not made-up ones
