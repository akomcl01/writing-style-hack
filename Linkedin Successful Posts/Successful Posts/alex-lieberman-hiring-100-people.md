I need to hire 100 people in the next 12 months.

Tenex is a rocket ship. Unlike anything i've seen.

Our biggest bottleneck is keeping up hiring with the tidal wave of demand we're seeing.

Which takes me to the first role I need to fill: Director of People Ops.

We need a hands-on, foundational leader who will build and scale the People function as the company grows from ~15 to 100 employees and beyond.

Must haves:
- 5–10 years in HR/People Ops, ideally across multiple scaling stages (50–250 employees)
- Prior experience as a Head of, Director, or Senior Manager of People in a high-growth SaaS or startup.
- Pumped to own all aspects of People Ops, Employee Experience, Compliance, and Talent Development

That leads me to the other 2 roles we're hiring for, the dynamic duo of client delivery in our business.

Next up: AI Strategist.

You are the voice of the customer.

If a customer success savant & world-class PM had a baby, it'd look like our AI Strategist.

The job: Translate client goals into reality by uncovering bottlenecks and inefficiencies, aligning stakeholders, and executing change‑management and software‑implementation plans that unlock AI‑driven leverage.

Must haves: deeply technical + previous experience as a technical consultant, PM, sales engineer, or similar role.

Last up, is their technical partner: the Forward Deployed Engineer.

Must-haves: elite engineering chops, AI-first mindset,
relentless curiosity, team multiplier, client-facing.

Oh...one more thing...your comp range is $250,000-$800,000.

Why? It's uncapped (based on storypoint output). We pay you like a salesperson.
