Our marketing team is just me and ~40 AI agents.

I finally got around to putting them into an "org chart", and it's actually really cool to see!

Plus, laying them out this way by sub-function (social media, blog, email, community, partners, etc) has given me a bunch of ideas of other agents I want to build.
