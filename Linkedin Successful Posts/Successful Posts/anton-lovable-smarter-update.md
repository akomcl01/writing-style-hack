Introducing a smarter Lovable that is 71% better at solving complex tasks.

Lovable can now do more work, more autonomously – using deeper planning, browser testing, and prompt queuing.

This is what's new:

1. Automated testing: Get higher quality builds with fewer issues. Lovable now tests your apps like a real user, and fixes them like an experienced developer. It opens its own browser, navigates flows, investigates edge cases, and catches bugs. When it finds problems it fixes them on the spot.

2. More intelligent planning: Lovable maps out your features before coding. It asks more thoughtful questions to understand exactly what you need, creates detailed, editable plans, and shows you what it's building at every step without losing the plot.

3. Prompt queueing: Stack multiple prompts while Lovable works. Queue ideas without breaking flow and collaborate on projects without waiting for your turn.

4. Seamless Google authentication: Add Google sign-in in one prompt and build instant trust with your app visitors. Before, you would have to create a Google developer account and set up through manual configuration in the Google Cloud Console.

This is a huge step toward where we're taking Lovable, read more about today's update here: https://lnkd.in/gKpSeT3r
