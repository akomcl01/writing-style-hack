I think it's time to redefine what "success" means in SaaS.

for decades, it was measured by how big you could get — global reach, millions in ARR, VC rounds that made headlines. that made sense back then. building software used to cost millions. you needed years to hit PMF, full-stack teams, and access to engineering talent that only 3% of the population had.

that equation's collapsing. the cost of development is near zero comparatively speaking. vibe coding is letting anyone build products in days, not years. you can build something real for a few thousand bucks — sometimes less.

sam altman called it the era of "fast fashion SaaS."
i disagree.

i think we're entering the era of "mom-and-pop SaaS".
small, local, purpose-built products that serve real communities. not global domination — but sustainable, lovable businesses that let their creators make a comfortable living.

the future of software isn't scale.
it's community.
