Motion graphics were always the hardest part of making videos for me. Hours in After Effects for 10 seconds of movement.

Now I can do them 10x faster without touching a timeline or writing a single line of code.

@Remotion released a skill that lets Claude Code create videos programmatically. I spent 5 hours building with it so I could show you exactly how it works.

What's in the guide:

- Installing the Remotion skill (takes 2 minutes)
- Creating your first video scene by scene
- Auto-editing long videos into clips
- Adding animated captions and subtitles
- Reframing for TikTok/Reels/Shorts
- Stacking multiple skills into a mini production studio

This is for content creators, marketers and GTM engineers who want to create more videos, better and faster, without learning video editing software or code.

I recorded the full walkthrough. Every step.
