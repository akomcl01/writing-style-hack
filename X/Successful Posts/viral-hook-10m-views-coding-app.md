## How a Viral Hook Drove 10M Views for a Coding App

the formula is **stupid simple**:

- **shocked face** (0:00-0:03)
- builds tension with "wait this can't be real"
- shows the solution doing impossible thing

after the hook screen:

- go to [app name]
- type the app you want to build
- watch AI write everything

no explanation. no tutorial voice. just pure demo.

### Why It Works

the reason it works is the **implied illegality**. viewer thinks they're seeing something that shouldn't exist yet.

**TikTok's algorithm** rewards confusion in the first 3 seconds. this format is pure confusion.

### Hook Performance Breakdown

same creator tested 4 hooks on same app:

- "this AI builds apps" = 47k views
- "I built an app in 10 minutes" = 89k views
- "how is this legal" = 10.2M views

**216x difference**. same app. same demo. different hook.

the best part is you don't need the app to be controversial. **the hook creates the controversy**.
