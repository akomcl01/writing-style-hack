# YouTube Outline Skill

Use this skill when creating YouTube video outlines. This is for **outlines only** — not full scripts with dialogue. The goal is to structure the video flow, not write what the creator will say.

---

## What This Skill Produces

For every YouTube outline request, deliver:

1. **Video Outline** — The structure and flow of the video
2. **3 Title Options** — Optimized for clicks and clarity
3. **3 Thumbnail/Cover Art Suggestions** — Visual concepts that pair with titles

---

## Video Outline Structure

### Opening (0:00 - ~1:00)
- **Hook** — The attention-grabbing opening moment
- **Promise** — What the viewer will learn/get by watching
- **Credibility** — Why you're the one to teach this (brief)

### Setup (~1:00 - ~3:00)
- **Context/Problem** — The situation or challenge being addressed
- **Why Now** — Why this matters right now
- **Overview** — Quick roadmap of what's coming

### Core Content (~3:00 - ~80% of video)
Structure as numbered sections with:
- **Section Title** — Clear, descriptive header
- **Key Point** — The main idea of this section
- **Demo/Example** — What you'll show or walk through
- **Transition** — How this connects to the next section

### Conclusion (Final ~2-3 minutes)
- **Recap** — Key takeaways (3-5 bullet points max)
- **Call to Action** — What you want viewers to do
- **Tease** — What's coming next / related content

---

## Outline Format

Use this format for outlines:

```
# [WORKING TITLE]

## HOOK
[1-2 sentences describing the opening moment]

## PROMISE
[What viewer gets from watching]

## SETUP
- Context: [situation/problem]
- Why now: [timeliness/relevance]
- Overview: [quick roadmap]

## CORE CONTENT

### Section 1: [Title]
- Key point: [main idea]
- Show: [what to demo/display]
- Transition: [bridge to next section]

### Section 2: [Title]
- Key point: [main idea]
- Show: [what to demo/display]
- Transition: [bridge to next section]

[Continue for all sections...]

## CONCLUSION
- Recap: [3-5 key takeaways]
- CTA: [what to do next]
- Tease: [future content hint]

## TIMESTAMPS (Estimated)
- 00:00 [Section name]
- 00:00 [Section name]
- [etc.]
```

## Title Guidelines

Generate 3 title options using these patterns:

### Pattern 1: Specific Outcome
> "How I [achieved specific result] with [method]"
> "The Complete Guide to [doing X] in [timeframe]"

### Pattern 2: Curiosity Gap
> "[Unexpected thing] is happening in [space]"
> "Why [authority figure] stopped doing [common thing]"

### Pattern 3: Direct Value
> "[Number] [things] Every [audience] Needs to Know"
> "Build [thing] from Scratch (Step-by-Step)"

**Title Rules:**
- Under 60 characters when possible
- Front-load the most important words
- Include specifics (numbers, names, outcomes)
- Avoid clickbait that doesn't deliver

---

## Thumbnail/Cover Art Guidelines

Generate 3 thumbnail concepts. Each should include:

### Required Elements
- **Visual focus** — The main image/graphic (face, screenshot, object)
- **Text overlay** — 3-5 words max, large and readable
- **Emotion/Energy** — The vibe (shocked, excited, serious, playful)
- **Color scheme** — Primary colors that pop

### Thumbnail Patterns That Work

**The Reaction Shot**
- Creator's face with strong emotion
- Bold text with key phrase
- High contrast background

**The Before/After**
- Split screen showing transformation
- Minimal text
- Clear visual difference

**The Demo Preview**
- Screenshot of the thing being built/shown
- Arrow or highlight pointing to key element
- Text stating the outcome

**The Minimalist**
- Single strong visual
- One word or short phrase
- Clean, uncluttered

### Thumbnail Rules
- Text must be readable at small sizes (mobile)
- Face + text usually outperforms text-only
- Contrast matters — light text on dark, dark on light
- Avoid small details that disappear at thumbnail size

```

## What NOT to Include

- Full dialogue or scripted lines
- Word-for-word narration
- Exact timing (use estimates only)
- B-roll shot lists (unless specifically requested)

The creator will fill in the actual words. This skill provides the **structure and flow**.
