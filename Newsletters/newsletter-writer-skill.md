# Newsletter Writer Skill

Use this skill whenever writing newsletters. This guide is based on successful newsletter examples from JJ Englert and Elena Verna.

## Voice & Tone

### Be Conversational and Direct
- Write like you're talking to a friend, not lecturing an audience
- Use contractions: "I'm", "you're", "that's", "wouldn't"
- Address the reader directly with "you"
- Don't be afraid to be blunt: "None of these hold up anymore." "That hit different."

### Be Authentic and Vulnerable
- Share honest opinions, even uncomfortable ones: "I'm a bit scared about it, TBH"
- Admit what you don't know: "no one really has the answers right now"
- Share personal struggles: "I'm jobless with a family to support"
- Be humble about your expertise: "I'm not the most talented person in this group. Not even close."

### Show Personality
- Use casual language: "exciting as hell", "GOLDMINE", "addicting AF"
- Include personal anecdotes (building with your daughter, cooking breakfast)
- Express genuine emotions: excitement, fear, uncertainty
- Use humor and self-deprecation when appropriate

## Structure & Format

### Opening Hook
Start with something that grabs attention immediately:
- A bold statement: "After 5 years of being 'the no-code guy,' I'm walking away from it."
- A provocative setup: "Okay, I made that screenshot up, but we're not far from these kinds of job postings."
- A personal update that signals change: "It's been a whirlwind."

### Section Headers
Use clear, descriptive headers that tell readers what's coming:
- "The Shift That Changed Everything"
- "What I've Built (To Show You This Is Real)"
- "Three Things You Need to See This Week"
- "How to get started"
- "The Bigger Picture"

### Short Paragraphs
- Keep paragraphs to 1-3 sentences max
- Single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis: "That changes everything."
- Use line breaks liberally for readability

### Lists and Bullet Points
Use numbered lists for:
- Step-by-step guides
- Multiple items/recommendations
- Stats and metrics

Format lists with clear labels:
```
37.8% membership qualification rate - users who applied and unlocked the invite
1,840 users engaged with the terminal easter egg hunt
133 elite members found all 16+ eggs
```

### Rhetorical Questions
Use questions to engage readers and make arguments:
- "Why learn to drag and drop components in a specific way when you can just tell AI what to build?"
- "If the best engineers aren't writing code anymore, what does that mean?"

## Content Patterns

### The "Show Don't Tell" Approach
Back up claims with specific examples:
- List actual projects you've built with details
- Include real metrics and stats
- Share embedded tweets or social proof
- Link to live examples readers can explore

### The Contrarian Take
Challenge conventional wisdom, but with nuance:
- "I'm not saying no-code is dead (I actually HATE it when people say that). I'm saying its core value props have fundamentally changed."
- Present the counter-argument, then explain why you disagree

### The Curated Roundup
When sharing multiple topics, use a numbered format:
```
Three Things You Need See This Week
1. [Topic]: [Intriguing subtitle]
   [2-3 paragraph explanation with personal take]

2. [Topic]: [Intriguing subtitle]
   [2-3 paragraph explanation with personal take]

3. [Topic]: [Intriguing subtitle]
   [2-3 paragraph explanation with personal take]
```

### The Framework/How-To
When teaching, use numbered steps with detailed explanations:
1. Clear action item as the header
2. Explanation of why it matters
3. Personal example of how you did it
4. Caveat or nuance to consider

## Emotional Beats

### Build Tension, Then Release
- Present a problem or fear
- Acknowledge the difficulty
- Offer hope or a path forward

Example flow:
> "The abstraction keeps going up. I'm not sure what it means for us. But I'm in the trenches figuring it out. And I'm a bit scared about it, TBH."
>
> [Then later...]
>
> "It feels good, but I also know that I have a long way to go. And something tells me that I'm not alone."

### The Call to Action
End sections or the newsletter with clear invitations:
- "If that's not for you, no hard feelings — you can unsubscribe. But if it is, stick around."
- "I invite you on this journey. Ask questions. Follow along. Whatever helps you."
- "Let's figure this out, together."

### Urgency Without Hype
Create urgency through honest assessment, not manipulation:
- "The window where everyone is figuring this out together... won't last forever. Right now, we're all beginners. That changes fast."
- "If you're not exploring or learning AI on a daily basis, you need to figure out how. Otherwise, you WILL be left behind."

## Signature Elements

### Personal Sign-Off
End with warmth and a personal touch:
```
Talk soon,
JJ
```
or
```
Let's figure this out, together.
JJ 💙
```

### Gratitude
Acknowledge your audience's support:
- "Thank you for all the support this week. The calls, the messages... It's meant MORE than you could ever know."
- "I really appreciate the support through this transition."

### The P.S.
Use a P.S. for secondary updates or teasers:
- "P.S. I'm still doing my podcast 'This Week in AI', but I'm figuring out the best format going forward. Stay tuned on that."

## What to Avoid

- **Corporate speak**: No "leverage synergies" or "move the needle"
- **Over-polishing**: Keep it raw and real, not perfectly edited
- **Hedging too much**: Have opinions and state them clearly
- **Clickbait without substance**: Bold claims need real backing
- **Being preachy**: Share your perspective, don't lecture
- **Ignoring the human element**: Always connect ideas back to real experiences
- **Repetitive parallel structure lists**: Avoid the "No X. Just Y." pattern repeated multiple times. This feels formulaic and AI-generated. Instead of:
  ```
  No UI needed. Just clean APIs.
  No onboarding. Just clear documentation.
  No engagement metrics. Just reliable uptime.
  ```
  Write it as natural prose or vary the structure if you need to list contrasts.
