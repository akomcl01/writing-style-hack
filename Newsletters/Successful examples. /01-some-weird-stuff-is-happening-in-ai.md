Title: Some weird stuff is happening in AI

It's been a whirlwind.

As many of you know, I recently joined Tenex Labs — a premier AI agency in New York City led by Alex Lieberman. We currently a small team of 15 (aiming to grow to 150 this year), and the volume of work we're doing is absurd. We can't hire fast enough. And the clients we're working with aren't small startups — these are Fortune 500 companies, major enterprises, names you'd recognize. The demand for AI implementation is unlike anything I've seen, and it's only accelerating.

This has fundamentally changed what I want to share with you.

What I'm Building Toward
I now run a community of 400+ (3,500 on wait list) of the best Claude Code developers in the world. Engineers from Apple, OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, AWS, major banks — people building at the cutting edge of what's possible with AI agents and coding assistants.

Here's the honest truth: no one really has the answers right now.

And that's exactly why this moment is special. Normally, you can't get access to this caliber of talent. But because things are changing so fast, because everyone is trying to learn together, we've built this incredible group where senior engineers are sharing what they're building, how they're building it, and the things they're learning in real-time.

I'm not the most talented person in this group. Not even close. But I've been given a front-row seat, and my goal is to report back — to curate what I'm learning and share it with you.

So that's the direction this newsletter is going. The latest in AI. What's actually working. What's hype. What you need to pay attention to.

If that's not for you, no hard feelings — you can unsubscribe. But if it is, stick around.

Three Things You Need See This Week
1. Moltbook: The Social Network You Can't Join (Because You're Human)
Something wild is trending on X right now. There's a social network called Moltbook where every single user is an AI agent. No humans allowed to post. They're debating philosophy, sharing security advice, and discussing their "humans" — that's us.

I went deep on this and wrote up what I found. It's fascinating, a little unsettling, and a preview of where things are headed.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the post. TBH I don't like this. It scares me.

2. Create Videos With Claude Code (Remotion Guide)
I dropped this one yesterday and it might have gotten buried by the Moltbook chaos, but it's worth your attention.

Remotion released a skill that lets you create videos programmatically with Claude Code. I spent 5+ hours playing with it and put together a complete guide — from your first video to stacking AI skills for full automation.

Honestly, by the time I finished recording, I had learned so much that I wanted to reshoot the entire thing. But I shipped it anyway because perfect is the enemy of done. The potential here is massive: auto-editing long videos, generating motion graphics, adding AI voiceovers — all from prompts.


3. Ryan Carson on Building Agents That Compound with self learning (Private Recording)
This one's a treat. Ryan Carson, one of the minds popularizing ralph (the Agent Orchestration Network that's been making waves), did a private talk inside our Claude Code community this week.

He broke down how to build agents that compound on each other. Not just one-off automations, but systems where each agent makes the next one stronger. The math gets wild fast.

This is normally members-only, but I wanted to share it with you all. If you're thinking about agent workflows at any scale, this is worth your time.

Watch the recording here (keep it private please)

New YouTube Channel: 10x Builder
I'm launching a dedicated YouTube channel called 10x Builder where I'll be posting one video every week showing the latest AI tools in action. Real builds, real workflows, honest takes on what works and what doesn't.

The Remotion video is already there. More coming soon.

The Bigger Picture
I'm an optimist by nature. But I'm also paying attention.

AI is going to change everything. Some of it will be scary. Some of it will be genuinely good. Moltbook is a perfect example — it's weird, it raises questions we don't have answers to, and it's also kind of beautiful in a strange way.

What I know for sure: you need to start learning these skills now.

You can wait. But the longer you wait, the harder the catch-up becomes. I'm not saying you need to go build an autonomous agent swarm tomorrow. But you should:

Get into tools like Claude Code, Codex, or whatever resonates with you

Start building small projects with AI, even just asking questions

Find a community or partner who can help you navigate this

The window where everyone is figuring this out together — where you can learn alongside senior engineers from top companies — won't last forever. Right now, we're all beginners. That changes fast.

P.S. I'm still doing my podcast "This Week in AI", but I'm figuring out the best format going forward. Stay tuned on that.

Thank You
I really appreciate the support through this transition. My goal is to stay genuine provide you all with an honest perspective on what's happening in AI, curated from the best people I have access to.

If that's valuable to you, stick around. And if there's anything I can do to help, just reply to this email.

Talk soon,
