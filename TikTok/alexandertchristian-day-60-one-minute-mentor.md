## Script

There's three UX design portfolio mistakes that I see constantly, and they quietly kill a lot of great candidates. Welcome to day 60 of the one-minute mentor, simple UX career advice from my 20 years in the business.

Most designers build their portfolio for other designers. They optimize for sexiness, visual polish, and interesting layouts. I get it, it's understandable, but it misses the real audience. The person reviewing your portfolio is usually tired, short on time, and context switching between candidates. A lot of people fail because they don't help that person orient themselves.

But here's a simple way to reset how you think about case studies:

Does the opening screen clearly state the problem being solved and why it mattered? If I can't understand the problem, I lose trust fast.

Is it obvious who the work was for and what constraints shaped the decisions? Good design is always contextual. If the context is missing, then the work will always feel abstract.

Can I see what changed because of your involvement? Not just what was produced, but what moved, improved, and became clearer.

Design your portfolio like a product for one core user. Make it easy for them to understand the problem, the stakes, and your judgment. Keep following for tomorrow's lesson.
